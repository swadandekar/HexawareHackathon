#This project is using the Hapi.js Framework.
#Index.js file has following end points 

1. Get Block ( http://localhost:8000/block/{BlockHeight})
2. Post Block 
3. http://localhost:8000/requestValidation
4. http://localhost:8000/message-signature/validate
5. http://localhost:8000/stars/address:[address]
6. http://localhost:8000/stars/hash:[hash]

Points to note :

1. Implemented all the validation as mentioned in the Rubric.
2. Please let me know in case if I have over thought and put unnecessary validation.
3. I had raised the point that we are not receiving any response/ help from the mentor over the chat. But still nothing has improved. Could you please put the request again to Udacity on my behalf.


Thanks & Regards,
Swati
